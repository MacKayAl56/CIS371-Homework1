                <p>In <b>Area 1</b>, I uploaded a picture of me 
                    and a cat and used the <code>height=</code> attribute
                    to allow this photo to fit in the 100px height.
                    I also wrote <code>.center</code> in CSS to
                    correctly center this picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <b>Area 2</b>, I used headers to write my
                    name and number as well as uploaded a phone icon
                    the same way I uploaded the image of me but instead,
                    put it in the header.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <b>Area 3</b>, I am currently organizing this
                    report into separate paragraphs based on area numbers
                </p>
                <p> In <b>Area 4</b>, I created a table to list
                    previous classes i've taken using <code>table, tr, and td</code>
                    and used CSS pseudo classes to alternate the background color.
                    Then, used <code>:hover</code> to change the color when
                    the cursor hovers over one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <b>Area 5</b>, I uploaded a picture using <code>img</code>
                    and centered it the same way I did previously.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In <b> Area 6</b>, I created a list of 
                    abbreviations that linked to its company website using 
                    <code>li</code>.
                </p>
                <p> In <b> Area 7</b>, I wrote a little to demonstrate my understanding of
                    <code> b, i, and code</code>.
                </p>
                <p> Finally, in <b> Area 8</b>, I uploaded social media icons
                    and linked them to their websites as well as centered and spaced them
                    all out.
                </p>

                <p><b>My Favorite Line of Code</b><p>
                <p>In this paragraph I will
                show you my favorite line of code. This line of code is 
                so simple that anyone can write! That's why I <i>LOVE</i> it so much!
                Take a look at this Javascript code:</p>
                <p><code> console.log("Hello World!");</code></p>
                <p>Isn't that just amazing?? There's just something about 
                    the console.log function that gives me immense joy! As well
                    as the string <i>"Hello World!"</i> is so classic that even 
                    non-programmers have heard of it!
